One Thing Remains

Higher than the mountains that I face
Stronger than the power of the grave
Constant through the trial and the change
One thing remains
One thing remains

Your love never fails 
it never gives up 
it never runs out on me

On and on and on and on it goes
It overwhelms and satisfies my soul
And I never ever have to be afraid
One thing remains

In death and in life 
I'm confident and covered by the power 
of your great love

My debt is paid 
there's nothing that can separate my heart 
from your great love
