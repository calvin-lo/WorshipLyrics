At The Cross

Oh Lord You've searched me
You know my way
You fail with my failure
I know You love me

Your holy presence
Surrounded me
In every season
I know You love me
I know You love me

At the cross I bow my knees
Where Your blood was shed for me
There's no greater love than this

You have overcome the grave
Glory fills the highest praise
What can separate me now

You go before me
You shield my way
Your hand upholds me
And I know You love me

At the cross I bow my knee
Where Your blood was shed for me
There's no greater love than this

You have overcome the grave
Your glory fills the highest praise
What can separate me now

At the cross I bow my knee
Where Your blood was shed for me
There's no greater love than this, no

You have overcome the grave
Glory fills the highest praise
What can separate me now

You taught a way, You made a way
When You said that it is done
You taught a way, You made a way
When You said that it is done

And when the earth fails
Falls from my eyes
And You stand before me
I know You love me
Oh, I know You love me

At the cross I bow my knee
Where Your blood was shed for me
There's no greater love than this, no

You have overcome the grave
Glory fills the highest praise
What can separate me now

At the cross I bow my knee
Where Your blood was shed for me
There's no greater love than this, no

You have overcome the grave
Glory fills the highest praise
What can separate me now

You taught a way, You made a way
When You said that it is done
You taught a way, You made a way
When You said that it is done

You taught a way, You made a way
When You said that it is done
You taught a way, You made a way
When You said that it is done
