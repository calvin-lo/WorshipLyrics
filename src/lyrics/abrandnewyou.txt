A brand new you
全新的你

你说阴天代表你的心情 
雨天更是你对生命的反映
你说每天生活一样平静 
对于未来没有一点信心
You said gloomy days reflects how you feel
And rainy days is your reflection of life
You said each day is more or less the same
Without much to look forward to in the future

亲爱朋友你是否曾经
曾经观看满天的星星
期待有人能够了解你心
能够爱你  赐你力量更新
Dear friend, have you ever
Ever looked at the night full of stars
Wishing that someone would understand what’s in your heart?
Would love you, give you power to renew your life?

耶稣能够叫一切都更新
耶稣能够体会你的心情
耶稣能够改变你的曾经
耶稣爱你，耶稣疼你 
耶稣能造一个全新的你
Jesus can make everything new
Jesus can understand how you are feeling
Jesus can change even your past
Jesus loves you, Jesus dearly cares about you
 Jesus can create in you a new “you”
