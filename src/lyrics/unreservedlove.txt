Unreserved Love
愛是不保留

常听说世界爱没长久，
哪里会有爱无尽头？
尘俗的爱只在乎曾拥有，
一刻灿烂便要走！
I’ve always been told love won’t survive, 
Promises will turn into lies, 
The world just thinks love comes and passes through, 
It never lasts pure and true.

而我却确信爱是恒久，
碰到了你已无别求：
无从解释、不可说明的爱，
千秋过后仍长存不朽！
Make my life a fragrant offering I pray, 
Help me Lord to serve you truly every day, 
Through tears and joy I’ll give you all my praise, 
Let the whole world know your love and grace

谁人受痛苦被悬挂在木头？
至高的爱尽见于刺穿的手；
看！血在流反映爱没保留，
持续不死的爱到万世不休！
On the cross you died and took away my curse, 
Love so wondrous no one ever could deserve, 
Your bleeding hands proved your love unreserved, 
You’re my greatest joy and treasure on the earth. 

惟求奉上生命全归主所有，
要将一切尽献于我主的手；
我已决定今生再没所求，
惟望得主称赞已足够！
Make my life a fragrant offering I pray, 
Help me Lord to serve you truly every day, 
Through tears and joy I’ll give you all my praise, 
Let the whole world know your love and grace
