I Surrender All (All To Jesus)

All to Jesus I surrender
All to Him I freely give
I will ever love and trust Him
In His presence I will live
All to Jesus I surrender
Savior make me wholly thine
Let me feel Your Holy Spirit
Truly know that You are mine

All to Jesus I surrender
All to Him I freely give
I will ever love and trust Him
And in His presence I will live
I surrender all, I surrender all

All to Jesus I surrender
Lord, I give myself to thee
Fill me with Your love and power
Let Your blessing fall on me
All to Jesus I surrender
Now I feel the sacred flame
O the joy of Your salvation
Glory, glory, to His name

All to Jesus I surrender
All to Him I freely give
I will ever love and trust Him
And in His presence I will live
I surrender all

At Your feet I lay me down
All my scars and all my crowns
Jesus, I surrender all (I surrender all)
No more having my own way
No more chasing yesterday
Jesus, I surrender all (I surrender all)

All to Jesus I surrender
All to Him, all to Him I freely give
All to Jesus I surrender
All to Him I freely give
I will ever love and trust Him
And in His presence I will live
I surrender all, I surrender all

No more having my own way
No more chasing yesterday
Jesus, I surrender all (I surrender all)
I surrender all
